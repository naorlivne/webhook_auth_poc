# How to contribute

Being an open source project means any help offered will be greatly appreciated, below is a quick run through of how you
can help

## Getting Started

* Fork the latest branch of the component you want to contribute to
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Use virtualenv to install all requirements from the requirements.txt file, this may require having GCC compiler & libffi-dev depending on your environment setup due to gevent & bcrypt requiring compilation on some OS.
* Fix the issue you want \ add a feature
* Create a pull request

### Documentation

Being a POC there isn't much more then the readme, the /docs folder also includes the draw.io savefile of the workflow diagram.

## What you can help with

* Documentation - everyone hates them but without them would you be able to figure out how to use it?
* Bug fixes / feature requests - anything off github issues lists
* Submitting tickets - even if you don't have the time\knowledge to fix a bug just opening a github issue about it will greatly help
* Suggesting improvements
* Spreading the word

### Summary

* Your awesome for helping, thanks.

P.S.
